# NTT_Error_Detection
This repository provides the simulation and Vitis code of Error detection capable Number-Theoretic Transform published in "Efficient Algorithm Level Error Detection for
Number-Theoretic Transform Assessed on FPGAs"

The simulation part is based on the work https://github.com/acmert/ntt-based-polmul.
